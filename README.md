# <Module 1 Challenge>

## Description

In this project, I refactored the HTML of a website in order to make it more accessible. In order to make the code more descriptive
I swapped out nonsemantic elements for semantic elements. I also added <id> tags and <alt> tags so that text-to-speech readers can
better describe the contents of the page.
